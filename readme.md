## Installation

Ensure the requirements are met before installing.

The installation is currently somewhat complicated. Some PHP/Laravel experience will benefit. This will be streamlined in the future.

1. Clone the repository into a folder.
2. `cd` into folder and run `composer install` followed by `npm install` and `bower install`.
3. Run `gulp --production` to compile the JavaScript and css files.
4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill with your own database and mail details.
5. Ensure the `storage` & `bootstrap/cache` folders are writable by the web server.
5. In the application root, Run `php artisan key:generate` to generate a unique application key.
6. If not using apache or `.htaccess` files are disable you will have to create some  URL rewrite rules as shown below.
7. Run `php migrate` to update the database.
8. Done! You can now login using the default admin details `admin@admin.com` with a password of `password`. It is recommended to change these details directly after first logging in.

#### URL Rewrite rules

```

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
