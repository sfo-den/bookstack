## Development & Testing

All development on BookStack is currently done on the master branch. When it's time for a release the master branch is merged into release with built & minified CSS & JS then tagged at it's version. Here are the current development requirements:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

SASS is used to help the CSS development and the JavaScript is run through browserify/babel to allow for writing ES6 code. Both of these are done using gulp.

BookStack has many integration tests that use Laravel's built-in testing capabilities which makes use of PHPUnit. To use you will need PHPUnit installed and accessible via command line. There is a `mysql_testing` database defined within the app config which is what is used by PHPUnit. This database is set with the following database name, user name and password defined as `bookstack-test`. You will have to create that database and credentials before testing.

The testing database will also need migrating and seeding beforehand. This can be done with the following commands:

```
php artisan migrate --database=mysql_testing
php artisan db:seed --class=DummyContentSeeder --database=mysql_testing
```

Once done you can run `phpunit` (or `./vendor/bin/phpunit` if `phpunit` is not found) in the application root directory to run all tests.
